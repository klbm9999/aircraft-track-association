# Govia - Aircraft Track Association Source Notes

These notes reflect the source context available for the exercise.
Optional attributes are not a normalized data dictionary.
Some meanings and conventions must be investigated; others may remain unresolved.

## Core Observation Fields

- `observation_id`: Unique observation reference. Identical retransmissions reuse it.
- `tracklet_id`: Fixed grouping of reports known to belong to one aircraft within that fragment.
- `observed_at`: Measurement time, ISO 8601 UTC with Z.
- `received_at`: Platform receipt time, ISO 8601 UTC with Z.
- `latitude` / `longitude`: Decimal degrees; north/east positive.
- `altitude_ft`: Altitude measurement in feet; may be omitted or null.
- `source`: Namespace identifying the contributing feed.
- `attributes`: Optional source-specific JSON fields.

All core fields except `altitude_ft` and `attributes` are required.
The documented time and position fields are sufficient to attempt the core association task.
Preserve original values when deriving or normalizing features.

## Available Source Context

The following are incomplete integration notes, not verified definitions for every attribute.

### feed-a

An older movement-report export.
Integration notes refer to speed in knots and a directional channel in degrees.
Records also contain reference-like values and source diagnostics.
There is no complete attribute mapping or validated quality-code interpretation.

### feed-b

A separate movement feed with shorter channel names.
Its numeric conventions were not standardized with feed-a.
Fields with matching names must not be assumed to share units or meaning.
No complete channel dictionary is available.

### feed-c

A movement feed from a different adapter.
Available notes mention metric speed values but do not specify the unit convention.
Some names were inherited from earlier exports.
Reference-like values and categorical codes are present, without guarantees about identity or ordering.

### telemetry-x

An auxiliary stream containing a mixture of sensor-related values and transport diagnostics.
Names alone do not establish that a field measures aircraft behavior.
No complete channel dictionary is available.

These sources may contain useful, redundant, unreliable, or irrelevant values.
A reference-like value is not an authoritative aircraft identity.
Its persistence and agreement with other evidence should be checked.

## Supporting Records and Joins

The `supporting.jsonl` file contains optional records from telemetry-x.
Each record has `record_id`, `observation_id`, `source`, `received_at`, and `attributes`.

- Join to position reports by `observation_id` within the same scenario and snapshot.
- Not every observation has a supporting record.
- Identical supporting retransmissions reuse `record_id`; deduplicate before aggregating.
- Supporting records can arrive later than their linked position reports.
- Receipt timestamps determine availability, not the time of aircraft movement.
- The join keys are defined; inferring undocumented join relationships is not part of the exercise.

## Interpretation Expectations

Investigate optional attributes using training data and select any resulting features or settings using validation data.
Do not use test labels to decode fields or revise interpretations.

For any optional field you use, explain:

- What you believe it represents and whether that meaning is documented or inferred.
- The checks supporting your interpretation, including units where relevant.
- How you handle missing, inconsistent, or implausible values.
- Whether it improves association results or provides useful supporting evidence.

Document unresolved assumptions.
Do not silently assign physical meaning or units based solely on a name, numeric range, or correlation.
You may exclude fields whose meaning or reliability you cannot establish.

You are not expected to identify every field.
A justified exclusion is acceptable, and using more attributes does not earn additional credit.
